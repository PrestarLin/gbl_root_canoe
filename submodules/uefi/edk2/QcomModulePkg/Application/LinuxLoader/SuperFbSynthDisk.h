/*
 * RAM-backed fake-GPT wrapper around one BlockIo extent.
 *
 * A raw partition exported to a PC reads back with no partition table at LBA0,
 * so the host shows it as an uninitialized disk and offers to initialize it -
 * which would write an MBR/GPT stub straight into the partition's first
 * blocks. The wrapper prepends a GPT built in RAM: the host sees a valid
 * one-partition disk, the exported extent appears as that partition, and any
 * host write to the GPT region is swallowed before it can reach the backing
 * device.
